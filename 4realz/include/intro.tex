\begin{frame}{What's a security capture the flag?}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item<1-> 48 hours of caffeinated reverse engineering and exploitation
        \item<2-> More seriously: an event where you break a bunch of programs
                  to retrieve hidden strings of text (the flags)
        \item<3-> An opportunity to learn new things - we wouldn't
                  even be presenting if it wasn't for this CTF
