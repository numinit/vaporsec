\section{Conclusion}

\subsection{Wrapping up}

\begin{frame}{So, what did we learn?}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item<1-> Emulators like QEMU can be used to help debug code for
                  non-native architectures
        \item<2-> Intel x86 vector instructions are complex, but we can get
                  past the complexity by following the documentation
        \item<3-> SMT solvers can be used to query constraints,
                  similarly to how you can use SQL to query lots of data
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{The end!}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item This presentation is built on the shoulders of giants; check out
              Dennis Yurichev's fantastic writeup on SAT and SMT solvers
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \url{https://yurichev.com/writings/SAT_SMT_draft-EN.pdf}
        \end{itemize}
        \item Z3 code for generating sudokus is at \url{https://goo.gl/ZC1546}
        \item Z3 code for solving the CTF challenge is available at
              \url{https://goo.gl/cJPJDN}
        \item Questions?
